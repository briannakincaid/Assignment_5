# The data was collected to gain insight about chemical treatments applied to food crops as fertilizer, insecticides, etc. 

## IMPORT/READ (readr)

## TIDY/CLEAN (tidyr)

## TRANSFORM/ORGANIZE (dplyr)

  #In class, we noted that some of the chemicals used on our food are classified RESTRICTED USE CHEMICALS. We isolated these chemicals in the veg1 dataset and found technical information about their toxicity in ECOTOX, the Beta version of ECOTOX, and the EPA Chenical Dashboard.

  #Make a table of toxicity measurements (at least LD50 for a single experimental animal). Use this table and what you know about dplyr joins to augment your evaluation of chemical treatments applied to vegetables.
